# NeuralNetwork
Project for Neural Networks.
This project provides a direct comparison showcasing the performances of the standard Quadratic function and the improved Cross-Entropy cost function used in Backpropagation.
Data set used here is taken from MNIST available for free at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
